#2048py
2048Â terminalerminal game made with Python.

This is the first time I build a project and use GitHub. I made it for fun and improving my coding skill. I use Python 2 to build this project.

How to play: 
I use the getch() function from  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-getch/">py-get library</a>. To use it, please install it with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> command:
<code>$ pip install py-getch</code>
  
Return the "W" key to turn up, "S" to turn down, "A" to turn left, "D" to turn right.

Update_260117: I change the coding format and the algorithm. Still have not had the "Game over" function. Instead, "list index out of range" error will stop you.

Update_270117: getch() function update. Add point calculating feature.
