#2048py
2048 game made with Python.

This is the first time I build a project and use GitHub.
I made it for fun and improving my coding skill.
I use Python 2 to build this project.

How to play: Return the "W" key to turn up, "S" to turn down, "A" to turn left, "D" to turn right.

#Update_260117: I change the coding format and the algorithm. Still have not had the "Game over" function. Instead, "list index out of range" error will stop you.
