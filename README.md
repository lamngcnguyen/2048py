#2048py
2048Â terminal game made with Python.

This is the first time I build a project and use GitHub. I made it for fun and improving my coding skill. I use Python 2 to build this project.

I use the getch() function from  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-getch/">py-get library</a>. To use it, please install it with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> command:
<p><code>$ pip install py-getch</code></p>

How to play: Return "W" key to turn up, "S" key to turn down, "A" key to turn left, "D" key to turn right.
