#2048py
2048 terminal game made with Python.

This is the first time I build a project and use GitHub. I made it for fun and improving my coding skill. I use Python 2 to build this project.

I use the getch() function from  <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-getch/">py-get library</a>. To use it, please install it with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">pip</a> command:
<p><code>$ pip install py-getch</code></p>

How to play: Run 2048py.py file. This game is made with Python 2 with some additional libraries: random, py-getch. Make sure if you have installed those librar. To play this game, return "w" key to turn up, "s" key to turn down, "a" key to turn left, "d" key to turn right, "x" key to exit the game. "Game over" feature will be added later, sorry for the bug.

Thank you for see this project!
